# Meeting 10-28 Minutes

- Explaining the data
  - cancer death is outcome
  - predictors are diverse: other death rates, economic variables, age, education
  - county level data of all 50 states, it's not all of the counties
  
- Delegating Parts of The Report
  - Parts 1 - 3 (introduction, table of data): Alex
  - Part 4 (exploratory data analysis): Christian 
  - Part 5 (initial analysis): Jasen
  - Deadline: Nov 3 okay?

- Presentation: 
  - People should just present their particular parts described above
  - Can use Google Drive for this: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EBkkb6x0Uzv8apnwczo8TgY3-1_3djSD_QP-uJGMy9A/edit?usp=sharing

- Using Github for the project
  - Distinguish between local copy on your computer and the collective one on Github
  - Teach how to associate an R project with the Github repo
  - pull-add-commit-push cycle
  - work in separate files, we'll compile everything together 

- Christian's ideas for project
  - use a more complex hypothesis test (maybe checking if all interaction values are 0?)
  - use everything that is taught to us throughout class (diagnostics, bootstrap)
  - ideally, everytime something new is learned, someone will do the codin and writing up for it and the other two will inspect
  - aka develop the report throughout the whole semester, rather than dedicate a weekend to all of it

- Next Meeting? 
  - Probably day before class to go over report & presentation details
  - Nov 2-4?

-Alex's ideas for project
  -Agree with all points Christian mentioned
  -Discuss in details regarding complex hypothesis
  -seek ideas on Christian's previous experience on the dataset and similar project if had any  
  -try to discuss explicitly the methods(diagonistics, bootstraps) each one would probably use
  -recommend next meeting to be on Monday evening before the internal deadline such that I can have more time to revise my part? 
  -get the documentation on the dataset

## TODO:
  - Christian:
    - get a data dictionary and add to the repo (done)
  - Everyone:
    - do your part for the report and presentation and have it mostly ready by Monday
